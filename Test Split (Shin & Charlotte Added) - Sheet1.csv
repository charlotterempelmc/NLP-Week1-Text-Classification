0,"This sweater is absoutely horrendous. Who let this company even sell such a disgusting piece of thing. I originally thought I liked it, but then I went to try it on in-store and I was horrified, how could anyone look good in this. It is IMPOSSIBLE. Do not buy."
0,the ABSOLUTE WORST. I am never going to this bakery again in my life. I got food poisoning a day after... never again 
0,DONT FALL FOR THE PERFECT DESCRIPTION . This straightener has made my hair so dry and my hair also doesnt stay straight for long time.
0,"This spa was disappointing in every regard. Cleanliness was severely lacking. Hair and dust were visible across the floors, and the bedding and pillowcases showed crumbs and small stains."
0,"This electric fan is USELESS! I can't believe I spent money on this cheap piece of junk. I will never again be shopping at this store. I plugged it in and it sparked, and the wire caught on fire. What an absolute waste of a product"
0,STAY AWAY!! I purchased this hair dryer a little over a month ago AND it has completely lost power. Buy it only if you want to waste money.
0,"I don’t want to describe how bad experience I was sent here. I got food poisoning from here,the inside of the chicken still raw and really soft, I believe it is really undercooked."
0,I wish I could rate my experience as less than 1 star. Be prepared for terrible services and some COCKROACHES. I found a bug (I did not get a good look of what it is exactly at first) in my bed at 2am then it flew away and went out of my sight. 
0,"Trash!Used it twice before it completely fell apart. The loops that hold the cloth mop head ripped on the one the first time using, the second one ripped the second time using. The velcro thats supposed to hold the mop head came right off so with no loops and no Velcro the thing is completely useless. "
0,Absolutely piece of garbage. Bought it for camping and when I went to plug it into the outlet in the car the plug part that connects to the pump itself was broken I definitely got a returned product or if it really does break that easy this company shouldn’t be in business
0,"This café was a huge disappointment. The space was uncomfortably cold, and the chairs were dirty with hairs. The staff lacked a sense of customer service, and the drinks were just average."
0,"This is by far the worst product purchased online ever, and the worst customer service. The product was faulty and needed a refund, and they only refunded less than a third of the price."
1,The servers were so rude. Need to give them customer service training! I am giving 1 star only because the food was not disappointing. 
1,"This eyeshadow palette is horrifying, I tried on a couple different shades and they are extremely gunky and thick and have left stains on my eyelids. Please send help, this is not okay. Will not be buying from them ever again."
1,"Skip it. The only good thing about this is the nice location. Other that that, nothing. We ordered an old fashioned ($29) & had to return it because it was terrible. Way overpriced and not worth the investment."
1,"This nightclub was horrendous... Who let the owners run this thing, seriously?! There was trash all over the floor and on the walls, there was barely any decorations or atmostpheric pieces and the music was some odd funky music that I just could not dance to... I am extremely dissapointed and the night was most definitly ruined due to this."
1,This peice of garbage disconnects the bluetooth itself after 1 or 2 hours. The worst bluetooth device I have ever bought.
1,"POOR SERVICE, I will not be going to this hair salon ever again. They were so rude and condescending, I had to wait sixty minutes at the time of my hair appointment to even be seated for a wash. I do not reccomend"
1,"Although the food was good, servers are too rude! Just snatched away stuffs from the table not talking to us properly. And the main thing is it wasn’t even busy!"
1,Everything is expensive here and NOT WORTH IT. One single hair clip for $14 with the quality of dollarstore- no thanks. I can go to Ardenes and get 3 large hair clips with better quality for $5. 
1,"Extremely difficult stove to use if the materials you're trying to use as fuel are wet, damp, or green. A decent stove if you bring dry wood to burn. The purpose of this purchase for me was to not have to bring fuel with me and I have found this stove is a one season stove good only for summer time use. "
1,"The stove I received doesn't match the description. It does not have the fold-out arms at the top, but instead has small prongs that look like they will not hold a pot securely. I have contacted the seller and sent them a photo as they requested, but they seem unwilling to replace it with the right model. Very disappointing."
1,Really strong unpleasant smell. Used 3 full bottles and I’ve seen zero changes to my hair. Each bottle lasts about two weeks if used as directed - really pricey for what you get.
1,The sweet treats are pretty good but coffee/ lattes are horrible. Firstly the cup is never full secondly coffee beans are not different and taste is wired. I was specifically there for the coffee and my cup was half filled and cold.
2,"These burgers tastes mid. I wish they weren't so greasy, I feel disgusting eating them. Well done, you. Now I have to go to the gym more often."
2,300$ for a table of 4.The food was so blend. Lacking some flavor. I did not feel like I hit the jackpot for spending this amount of money.
2,"We waited for 30 minutes because it was a famous place. We had high expectations because we were serious about coffee. But we were disappointed. It wasn't that great. It was similar to a regular cafe. This means that the food is not bad, but it is not good enough to wait in line."
2,This lip gloss is average. I like the color tint it gives but it leaves a weird aftertaste in my mouth that I do not appreciate very much. It is cheap though so not too bad.
2,"The design of this necklace is not bad, it is so sparkly. However, very cheap material. I feel itchy after wearing it for more then an hour. "
2,"I thought this water bottle was made with glass. Turned out it is plastic. With the price they are selling, it is not bad. It is still usuable but I prefer glass."
2,"At first I really liked this stand, but after 2.5 months of using it just regularly, the trim started to peel off (pictured). It doesn't necessarily affect the performance/utility of the stand, but for the price tag, I was really disappointed with the quality."
2,Love the concept but the sides have started to peel after 3 months of use. Not ideal for the price of this product.
2,Walking cane is not balanced well enough to stand alone. It needs to be improved so it is not consistently falling from a standing position. Specifically for handicap people like myself !!!
2,"Staff were very pleasant, and we received good service. The food was surprisingly disappointing. The two entrees we ordered were the veal entree and the rabbit ballotine, the flavors were there but the veal was super tough and required endless chewing. I think we were more disappointed, because of all the hype and recommendations to go here."
2,"I thought it has city skyline view due to some photos posted here. However, please do not expect good view from the park because it surrounds by house and house. It is normal park in community with little slope."
2,The quality and portions has been slowly going down hill. Not really worth the value compared to the other similar places. Still not too bad of a place to come every once in a while.  Business is still good for them since they always have a wait time for a table.
3,"I ordered a croissant and a latte. The pastry was delicious and fresh, but the coffee was disappointing."
3,"This nightclub is fabulous! It has a great bar, great drinks, great music, not much to complain about. If I had one complaint though, it would definitly be the smell of the bathroom... Though this might be common amonst clubs, this was a particularly interesting dewy smell. Please take care of that, other than that I had a great time!"
3,"Returns and exchanges are so easy, super quick and convenient. Customer service has been amazing!!"
3,"These rings are beautiful! I love jewelry and this is one of my go to brands, it is a little bit expensive but I would definitly recommend! I have worn these rings in the shower and in the pool, they still have not tarnished. I am extremely happy with these."
3,"It was quite delicious! This Mexican restaurant had a variety of burritos, vegetable bowls and tacos! The only downer was the atmostphere, the food was amazing but it was too dark and kind of gave creepy vibes."
3,"Other than the paid parking, this park is great to walk around and enjoy the nature. We saw seals, a blue heron, divers with oxygen tanks, people on the big boulders, and tons of natural scenery."
3,"Loved the experience. The combos are so comprehensive including a choice of cold drink, a carb like rice, noodles or vermicelli, a meat choice, and a basket of vegetables, fish balls, shrimp, and tofu. "
3,Good hotpot experience. The seating arrangement is like a bar. The servers are quick and nice.Food is good and worth the price.
3,"this is a cool little device. When I used it as a selfie stick with the camera, it was fine but it was quite difficult to hold it with the stick extended due to the weight of the camera."
3,It's very comfortable but has a strong smell of rubber that is still there after almost a month. Wish I knew that before because I am sensitive to smells. Otherwise good
3,Good Food with Good Service. Chasu Ramen is the best. Takoyaki could be better but the Karage is Amazing. 
3,"The food was really good. The service was ok. I didn’t have high expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised."
4,This nail polish is amazing! I love it. It stays for close to two weaks and does not ruin your nails! I definitly recommend trying! They have a whole collection of colors that you can try out and they don't smell bad either.  
4,I just wanted to say how thankful I am for the amiable service and the exquisite hairstyles they give us all the time. I believe all their products are amazing for the hair and in simple words this place is a “utopia for hair.” 
4,"WOW! Bigway is the BEST RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TO. The ingerdients were fresh. Their tomato borth was very flavorful. Would rate 10/10, definitly coming back here."
4,"OH MY GOODNESS! I absolutely LOVE this perfume! It smells like vanilla and is extremely refreshing. It lasts for a whole twelve hours and sometimes even stays the day after! This perfume was definitly worth the price, would definitly recommend."
4,"I LOVE MCDONALDS! Their chicken burgers always hit the spot every single time. How do they even do it?! Their fries are also AMAZING, just the right amount of saltiness and crispiness."
4,"I absolutely am in love with this candle! The scent is a beautiful mix of vanilla, coconut, and jasmine. It isn't too overpowering but is still quite strong. I love it, will keep on buying these candles!"
4,"Absolutely love this place! The latte was smooth, the pastries were fresh, and the staff made me feel welcome the moment I walked in. Easily my new go-to coffee spot."
4,"The sourdough loaf was incredible—crispy crust, soft center, and full of flavor. The employees were friendly and even threw in a free cookie. Five stars all the way!"
4,Great experience! The team helped me pick the perfect pair of headphones and took the time to explain all the features. Prices were fair and the service was excellent.
4,"One of the best meals I’ve had in a long time! The food was flavorful, the portions were generous, and the staff checked on us often. Highly recommend this place."
4,I am convinced this pizza was crafted by celestial beings. One bite and I swear I heard a choir. The crust? A perfect balance between crunch and tenderness. The cheese? Melted gold. I will dream about this pizza. I will write poetry about this pizza. I would give it 100 stars if I could.
4,"I walked in expecting a quick browse and instead found the meaning of life. The atmosphere wrapped around me like a warm blanket, and the owner recommended a book that healed a part of my soul I didn’t know was broken. This place is magic—real, tangible magic. Five stars isn’t enough."
